# PRML_Project
This project is regarding Diabetic Retinopathy Detection and Classification using Deep Learning Models. Initially, a transfer learning framework was used to compare between VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNetB3, and EfficientNetB4. Subsequently, it was arrived at that EfficientNetB4 was the better choice.
Several methods including regular hyper-parameter tuning, class-weighting, rotational augmentation, use of synthesizers like SMOTE and ADASYN were explored (Check Train_Experiments).
It became untenable to work with the present dataset and hence a new dataset had to be explored. The results on that dataset were more promising and it can be found in final-code.ipynb.
